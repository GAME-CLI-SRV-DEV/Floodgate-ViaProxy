# Floodgate-ViaProxy
Geyser Floodgate for Public ViaProxy. without it, why are we putting geyser in public viaproxy? seriously, if someone only purchased BE, they would be in trouble.

# What is Public ViaProxy?
Public ViaProxy is ViaProxy Server that is open to public.\
`address_port_version.viaproxy.hostname`\
`address.<address>.port.<port>.version.<version>.f2.viaproxy.hostname`\
or just, `hostname` (See [MiniConnect](https://github.com/ViaVersionAddons/MiniConnect))\
such as: Approximaster Public ViaProxy Server(viaproxy.approximasterstudios2004.ddnsgeek.com:25568/19132) and My Friend Lenni0451's ViaProxy Test Server is that thing.

# public viaproxy usage:

For SRV Syntax: `address_port_version.viaproxy.approximasterstudios2004.ddnsgeek.com:25568/19132`.\
it would be like: `2b2t.org_25565_1.21.4.viaproxy.approximasterstudios2004.ddnsgeek.com:25568/19132`\
For URI Syntax: `address.<address>.port.<port>.version.<version>.f2.viaproxy.approximasterstudios2004.ddnsgeek.com:25568/19132`.\
it would be like: `address.bombardiro-crocodilo.at.ply.gg.port.44051.version.1.21.8.f2.viaproxy.approximasterstudios2004.ddnsgeek.com:25568/19132`

however, you cannot join those servers without a Java Account(Honestly, whats the point of that). this is only helpful if you have only Android Edition, or you are Running SpongeVanilla.

> [!Note]
> If You are using ViaProxy without Public Mode or if you are using bungeecord, You dont need this!

# Installation:

Download the jar, and BAM!
you can now use public viaproxy easliy.
